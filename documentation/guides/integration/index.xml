Workspaces allow you to collaborate while designing your API and share your API artifacts like Postman Collections.
In this guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to directly connect Microcks to your Postman Collection living in a Workspace so that changes in Postman may be automatically propagated to Microcks.
1. Obtain an API Key In order to connect to your Postman Workspace, you&amp;rsquo;ll need an API Access Key so that Microcks will be able to authenticate while fetching your Collection.</description></item></channel></rss>
